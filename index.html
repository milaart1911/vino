            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Wine production was one of the most important agricultural processes in Roman Italy. In Late Antiquity (300-600 CE), the process of wine production included harvesting grapes, initial crushing by treading, subsequent pressing of the pulp, and finally transferring the grape juice to the storage area for fermentation.</p>

            <h3>Archaeological Findings</h3>
            <p>At the "Augustus Villa" in Somma Vesuviana, three vats used for wine production were found. In San Giusto, Apulia, two wineries with screw presses were discovered. These archaeological findings confirm the continuation of large-scale wine production in Late Antiquity.</p>
